Unlocking Insights into Claimant Representation with Predictive Analysis

I‚Äôm excited to share some key findings from our recent predictive analysis project focused on claimants in the insurance sector. 

üîç Data Diagnosis & Preparation:

Missing Values: Addressed missing data using custom imputation strategies (mean for numerical, mode for categorical, interpolation for datetime).
Outliers: Detected using the IQR method and treated by replacing outliers with median values to ensure robust modeling.
‚öñÔ∏è Balancing the Data:

The target variable (whether a claimant is represented by an attorney) was imbalanced. Applied RandomUnderSampler to balance the dataset.
ü§ñ Model Training & Evaluation:
We evaluated multiple classification algorithms to predict attorney representation, including Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.

Key Takeaways:

Data Quality: Properly handling missing values and outliers is crucial for accurate predictions.
Balancing Techniques: Effective resampling strategies are essential for dealing with imbalanced datasets.
Model Selection: Different models were evaluated, and the one with the best performance was selected for further analysis.
Future Steps:

Explore advanced resampling techniques, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning for even better performance.
Validate models on separate datasets to ensure real-world applicability.
This analysis not only highlights the power of data-driven decision-making but also provides actionable insights for improving claimant representation strategies.
